### Object Relational Mapping (ORM): E-commerce Back End

## Walkthrough Video

## App description
This application is using mysql2, Sequalize, the dotenv package and express.js API for creating RESTFul API routes for an E-commerce site. This application is the backend portion of an E-Commerce website. Express.js was used for the server and MySQL for the database along with Sequelize as the ORM to run SQL models and queries. The SQL database contains tables for products, categories, tags, and product tags. RESTful API routes are used to make requests and updates from the database which are joined through Sequelize queries.

## Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a working Express.js API WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize WHEN I enter schema and seed commands THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON WHEN I test the API with http verbs or methods GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core THEN I am able to successfully perform CRUD operation i.e. create, read, update, and delete data in my database.
